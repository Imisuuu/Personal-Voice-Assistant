**Personal Voice Assistant versio 1.0.0**

Feel free to use it, share it as yours. Probably this project won't be longer developed, 
so if you want to maintain it dm me on discord: `Imisuu#4451`.

To make this project work create a API key on openweathermap.org and put your API key in the api_key variable in 359 line and write your city in the city varialbe in 358 line.

Also you need to install these dependiencies:
-neuralintents
-speech_recognition
-pyttsx3 (only works on windows)
-pynput
-googletrans
-requests
-winsound (not sure if it's installed by default)
-pyperclip

If you have any issue please open new issue in the `Issues` tab.

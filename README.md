**Personal Voice Assistant version 1.0.0**

Feel free to use it, change code and share it. Probably this project won't be longer developed, 
so if you want to maintain it dm me on discord: `Imisuu#4451`.

To make this project work create a API key on openweathermap.org and put your API key in the api_key variable in 359 line and write your city in the city variable in 358 line.
Also change your program/games directories.

Also you need to install these dependiencies:
<li>neuralintents</li>
<li>speech_recognition</li>
<li>pyttsx3 (only works on windows)</li>
<li>pynput</li>
<li>googletrans</li>
<li>requests</li>
<li>winsound (not sure if it's installed by default)</li>
<li>pyperclip</li>
</ul>
If you have any issue please open new issue in the `Issues` tab.
